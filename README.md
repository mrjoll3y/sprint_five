#Overview

The software I developed is a scheduling tool for managing Walmart OPD (Online PIckup and Delivery) employee shifts. The goal of the project was to create a user-friendly interface where managers can add, update, or delete employee schedules, and the system will display them in an organized table. Additionally, the application automatically sorts the employees by their scheduled start time for better planning and ease of use.

My purpose for developing this software was to further my learning in web development, particularly in JavaScript and the integration of front-end technologies like HTML and CSS. I wanted to focus on dynamic data handling, form interactions, and manipulating the DOM. The project also helped me practice sorting algorithms and managing time-based data, which is a crucial skill when working on applications involving scheduling.

#Development Environment

Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – a popular and efficient code editor for web development.
Languages:
HTML: To structure the webpage and create the form and table elements.
CSS: For styling the page and creating a visually appealing layout.
JavaScript: To manage the employee data, handle form submissions, sort the schedule by start times, and update the table dynamically.
Web Browser: Google Chrome – used for testing and debugging the application in a live environment.
The project does not rely on external libraries or frameworks, focusing solely on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#Useful Websites

MDN Web Docs – For reference on JavaScript functions, CSS properties, and HTML elements.
W3Schools – For learning and testing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.
Stack Overflow – For troubleshooting specific coding issues and finding solutions to common problems.

#Future Work

Validation: Implement more robust input validation to handle edge cases, such as invalid times or empty fields.
Time Zone Support: Add the ability to handle employee schedules across multiple time zones.
Persist Data: Store employee data in local storage or a backend database so that schedules can be saved even after the browser is closed.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow different managers to securely access and modify the schedule.
